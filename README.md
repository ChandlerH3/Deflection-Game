# Deflection-Game
## Introduction

This project was to practice and learn about Object Oriented Programming(OOP). 

This game is called **Deflection-Game**. In this game, you play as Sekiro. You can move up, down, left or right with the arrows of your keyboard, and also you can also tap spacebar to deflect as an attack is coming. This will negate all damage.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the Charging bulls  The longer you stay alive, the higher your score!
